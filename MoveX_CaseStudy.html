        <h1>Case Study for Move-X full-stack project</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>MoveX is a library of movements from various styles and traditions, with descriptions/cues and video
                sources.
            </p>
            <p>It consists of a backend and two frontend clients. The backend is where the moves are stored in a
                database,
                as well as
                the API that allows apps to interact with the database. The frontend clients, one created with React and
                one
                with
                Angular provide the interface that allows user to browse the moves, view details about each move, style
                or
                source,
                manage their user profile and create a list of their favorite moves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Purpose & Objective</h2>
            <p>I built this personal project in the context of a CareerFoundry course to master full-stack web
                development.
            </p>
            <p>The goal was to create a fully functional, responsive and engaging web app to provide movers with
                inspiration
                and
                details about a variety of movements.</p>
            <p>The challenge was to build an API from scratch, set up and connect a database, as well as make use of the
                most popular
                frontend JavaScript libraries/frameworks – React and Angular – to create engaging interactive user
                interfaces.</p>
            <p>At the same time the project was set up to produce a great portfolio project and get used to common
                project
                requirements
                like user stories and user flows.</p>

            <h2>Duration</h2>
            <p>All in all it took approximately 3 month. For sure a lot more than a project like this should take in
                “real
                life”. But
                since it was a study projects, there were so many things to learn and figure out. I got really absorbed
                in
                it an at the
                end felt ready to call myself a web developer.</p>

            <h2>Credits</h2>
            <p> Big thanks goes to my tutor Ali El Zoheiry. Without him this would have been way less instructive and
                fun.
                And of course
                I also thank my mentor Ramadhan Aheebwa. Thanks also to Theano Eirini Kakaziani for great feedback on
                this
                case study.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <h3>Backend</h3>
            <div class="floating-img_container">
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="img/Screenshots/Screenshot_MoveX-API_2_small.png"
                        alt="Screenshot of the code for a MoveX API endpoint.">
                </div>
                <p>For the server side I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express as well as a non-relational
                    database (MongoDB).
                    The API allows to retrieve data about the moves and users from the database through common HTTP
                    requests
                    and returns JSON. API and database are connected by the business logic layer, using Mongoose.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="floating-img_container r">
                <p>I also implemented a login endpoint with basic HTTP authentication returning a authorization JWT
                    (token)
                    to the client.
                    This is necessary to ensure only logged in users can access the database. Initially the mechanisms
                    of
                    authentication and authorization were quite challenging for me. After with time and effort it become
                    clear and functional.<br>
                    To test the endpoints I used Postman.
                </p>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="img/Screenshots/Screenshot_MoveX-API_Postman.jpg"
                        alt="Screenshot of Postman, the software user to test the API endpoints.">
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>React client</h3>
            <div class="floating-img_container">
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="img/Screenshots/Screenshot_MoveX-React.png" alt="Screenshot of the MoveX React client.">
                </div>
                <p> Once the backend was set up, I created a frontend (the user interface) using React library. It is a
                    single-page,
                    responsive web application (SPA), built following the MVC design pattern. There are multiple views:
                    Registration, login,
                    main view (where all the moves are shown as cards), move view (where details about a specific move
                    are
                    elaborated),
                    style view and source view (details about the style/source, as well as all the matching moves in the
                    database) and a
                    profile view (here the user can edit their user data and view cards for their favorite moves).</p>

            </div>
            <p>This was the biggest and most challenging, but also very exciting part for me as there was a lot to learn
                starting off
                with React. Compared to pure/classical HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is a very different approach to
                interface creation
                and design. There were many topics I had to research, experiment with and figure out.</p>
            <div class="floating-img_container r">
                <p>In React everything consists of two types of components: class components (the "traditional" way) and
                    functional
                    components (a modern alternative). For the Move-X client I wrote a couple of each to practice both.
                    In a real-world
                    scenario more consistency would be advisable. In this case I would opt for mainly functional
                    components as I preferred
                    to work with them and they seem more efficient in several ways.</p>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="img/Screenshots/Screenshot_MoveX-React_components.jpg"
                        alt="Comparison of React class and functional components.">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="floating-img_container">
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="img/Screenshots/Screenshot_MoveX-React_redux.jpg" alt="React-Redux state management.">
                </div>
                <p>React-Redux added a huge level of complexity. It allows a much more sophisticated way to share
                    "state" (=
                    data) between
                    components by storing them in a central "store". Figuring out how that really works and how to
                    refactor
                    my
                    app took me a
                    while, but in the end it all made a lot of sense and worked smoothly. However in the future I would
                    search
                    for "updated"
                    alternatives that allow similar functionality with less complicated procedures.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Angular client</h3>
            <div class="floating-img_container r">
                <p>Later on I created another client accessing the same API and database. This time I used Angular
                    framework. It
                    is again a
                    single-page, responsive web application with mostly the same functionality as the React client, just
                    a
                    very
                    different
                    technology and new layout. In this version, after registration/login, there is just one main view
                    with a
                    slider to
                    display all moves. From there modals can be opened to display details about a style or source, as
                    well
                    as to
                    edit the
                    user profile.</p>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img class="screenshot" src="img/Screenshots/Screenshot_MoveX-Angular.png"
                        alt="Screenshot of the MoveX Angular client.">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Starting with Angular was a beast. It is a full-grown framework (compared to React being "just" a
                library),
                which means
                it comes with a lot more pre-defined structure and built-in functionality. But as soon as I started to
                understand the
                basic structure it started to make a lot of sense and recreating the client (with a completely different
                layout) was
                actually quite fast.</p>
            <div class="floating-img_container">
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="img/Screenshots/Screenshot_MoveX-Angular_userflow.jpg"
                        alt="User flow of the MoveX Angular client">
                </div>
                <p>Creating the layout, mostly following Material design, was also a new experience. It is a complex
                    world
                    but
                    in its
                    basics also surprisingly efficient and straight-forward. I was expecting to get a similar user flow
                    as
                    in
                    the react app,
                    but Angulars workflow automatically led me to create a much easier and more efficient result.</p>
            </div>
            <p>I am clearly not an Angular expert (yet), but I got to love it for its straight forward workflow and the
                clear,
                organized structure. For small projects it would clearly be an overkill though.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>MoveX was my first full-stack web application. Traversing from rather abstract server code and database
                structures all
                the way to two great user interfaces was a great achievement.</p>
            <p>The whole server side, with it’s security mechanisms and logic layers was quite challenging at first. But
                after a lot of
                research and some help from my tutor it all made sense.</p>
            <p>I especially found it very interesting to experience the two very different approaches of React vs
                Angular and their
                respective workflows.</p>
            <p>In React I liked the flexibility of modularity and the clarity of combining layout and functionality into
                a component.
                However Redux was a bit cumbersome. But maybe it is something one needs to get used to, to reap the
                benefits.</p>
            <p>Angular is great for it’s straight forward workflow and variety of great looking built-in elements. For
                such a small
                project is quite bulky though and contains a lot of unnecessary features. When I continue to work with
                Angular I would
                like to dive deeper into Material design.</p>
            <p>I couldn’t say that I like either React or Angular more than the other. They both have pros and cons and
                ultimately it
                will always depend on the scope and requirements of a project to choose appropriate tools.</p>
