            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                MoveX is a library of movements from various styles and traditions,
                with descriptions/cues and video sources.
            </p>
            <p>
                It consists of a backend and two frontend clients. The backend is
                where the moves are stored in a database, as well as the API that
                allows apps to interact with the database. The frontend clients, one
                created with React and one with Angular provide the interface that
                allows user to browse the moves, view details about each move, style
                or source, manage their user profile and create a list of their
                favorite moves.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Purpose & Objective</h2>
            <p>
                I built this personal project in the context of a CareerFoundry course
                to master full-stack web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal was to create a fully functional, responsive and engaging web
                app to provide movers with inspiration and details about a variety of
                movements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The challenge was to build an API from scratch, set up and connect a
                database, as well as make use of the most popular frontend JavaScript
                libraries/frameworks – React and Angular – to create engaging
                interactive user interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time the project was set up to produce a great portfolio
                project and get used to common project requirements like user stories
                and user flows.

            <h2>Duration</h2>
            <p>
                All in all it took approximately 3 month. For sure a lot more than a
                project like this should take in “real life”. But since it was a study
                projects, there were so many things to learn and figure out. I got
                really absorbed in it an at the end felt ready to call myself a web
                developer.

                Big thanks goes to my tutor Ali El Zoheiry. Without him this would
                have been way less instructive and fun. And of course I also thank my
                mentor Ramadhan Aheebwa. Thanks also to Theano Eirini Kakaziani for
                great feedback on this case study.

                        For the server side I created a RESTful API using Node.js and
                        Express as well as a non-relational database (MongoDB). The API
                        allows to retrieve data about the moves and users from the
                        database through common HTTP requests and returns JSON. API and
                        database are connected by the business logic layer, using
                        Mongoose.

                        <b>Authentication</b><br />
                        I also implemented a login endpoint with basic HTTP authentication
                        returning a authorization JWT (token) to the client. This is
                        necessary to ensure only logged in users can access the database.
                        Initially the mechanisms of authentication and authorization were
                        quite challenging for me. But after some time and effort it became
                        clear and functional.<br />
                        To test the endpoints I used Postman.

                    <p>
                        Once the backend was set up, I created a frontend (the user
                        interface) using React library. It is a single-page, responsive
                        web application (SPA), built following the MVC design pattern.
                        There are multiple views: Registration, login, main view (where
                        all the moves are shown as cards), move view (where details about
                        a specific move are elaborated), style view and source view
                        (details about the style/source, as well as all the matching moves
                        in the database) and a profile view (here the user can edit their
                        user data and view cards for their favorite moves).

                <b>Starting with React</b><br />
                This was the biggest and most challenging, but also very exciting part
                for me as there was a lot to learn starting off with React. Compared
                to pure/classical HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is a very different
                approach to interface creation and design. There were many topics I
                had to research, experiment with and figure out.

                    <p>
                        <b>Class VS functional components</b><br />In React everything
                        consists of two types of components: class components (the
                        "traditional" way) and functional components (a modern
                        alternative). For the Move-X client I wrote a couple of each to
                        practice both. In a real-world scenario more consistency would be
                        advisable. In this case I would opt for mainly functional
                        components as I preferred to work with them and they seem more
                        efficient in several ways.

                        React-Redux added a huge level of complexity. It allows a much
                        more sophisticated way to share "state" (= data) between
                        components by storing them in a central "store". Figuring out how
                        that really works and how to refactor my app took me a while, but
                        in the end it all made a lot of sense and worked smoothly. However
                        in the future I would search for "updated" alternatives that allow
                        similar functionality with less complicated procedures.

            <h3>Angular client</h3>

                    <p>
                        Later on I created another client accessing the same API and
                        database. This time I used Angular framework. It is again a
                        single-page, responsive web application with mostly the same
                        functionality as the React client, just a very different
                        technology and new layout. In this version, after
                        registration/login, there is just one main view with a slider to
                        display all moves. From there modals can be opened to display
                        details about a style or source, as well as to edit the user
                        profile.

                <b>Starting with Angular</b><br />
                Starting with Angular was a beast. It is a full-grown framework
                (compared to React being "just" a library), which means it comes with
                a lot more pre-defined structure and built-in functionality. But as
                soon as I started to understand the basic structure it started to make
                a lot of sense and recreating the client (with a completely different
                layout) was actually quite fast.

                        Creating the layout, mostly following Material design, was also a
                        new experience. It is a complex world but in its basics also
                        surprisingly efficient and straight-forward. I was expecting to
                        get a similar user flow as in the react app, but Angulars workflow
                        automatically led me to create a much easier and more efficient
                        result.

                I am clearly not an Angular expert (yet), but I got to love it for its
                straight forward workflow and the clear, organized structure. For
                small projects it would clearly be an overkill though.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                MoveX was my first full-stack web application. Traversing from the
                rather abstract server code and database structures all the way to two
                great user interfaces was an amazing achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole server side, with it’s security mechanisms and logic layers
                was quite challenging at first. But after a lot of research and some
                help from my tutor it all made sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>React VS Angular</b><br />
                I especially found it very interesting to experience the two very
                different approaches of React vs Angular and their respective
                workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
                In React I liked the flexibility of modularity and the clarity of
                combining layout and functionality into a component. However Redux was
                a bit cumbersome. But maybe it is something one needs to get used to
                to apprechiate it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Angular is great for its straight forward workflow and variety of
                great looking built-in elements. However for a small project like
                MoveX (in its current state) it is quite bulky and contains a lot of
                unnecessary features. When I continue to work with Angular I would
                like to dive deeper into Material design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I couldn’t say that I like either React or Angular more than the
                other. They both have pros and cons and ultimately it will always
                depend on the scope and requirements of a specific project to choose
                appropriate tools.
