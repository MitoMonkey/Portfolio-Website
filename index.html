        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>My name is Michael Flohrschütz. I am a <b>full-stack JavaScript web-developer</b> with a

      </div>

      <div class="cleared scroll-box">
        <p>I became a web developer because I enjoy <b>creating useful things</b>, <b>solving
            problems</b> and <b>optimizing functionality and

      <h1>Toolbelt</h1>
      <p>I can build web sites and apps from concept, layout and interactive elements to backend/server-side and
        databases.</p>
      <p>I understand being a web-developer as a continuous process of learning. So I am always open for new programming
        languages, frameworks, libraries, approaches, etc.</p>

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>This is a selection of my projects as a web developer.</p>
      <p>More details about the features, technologies, etc. of each project can be found in the respective readme file
        on
        GitHub.</p>
      <p>For the study projects created during the Full-stack Web-developer course @CarrerFoundry, I also worked with
        Kanban
        boards, user stories, user flows and architectural diagrams.</p>

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>Web development</h2>
        <p>Habitually I analyze how things could be optimized in functionality and usability, from software to movement
          patterns to
          a kitchen tool. I love developing code because it allows me to dive into a state of flow and enthusiasm. It
          sparks my
          curiosity and satisfies my joy in solving problems and crafting useful, innovative things.
          For me web technology is the contemporary and most efficient way to connect people on a large scale and assist
          them in
          every-day life to grow physically and mentally.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="scroll-box">
        <h2>The hemispheres</h2>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by things that integrate both hemispheres: Technology and creativity,
          understanding and
          experience, intellect and embodiment, logic and emotion.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing efficient, clean code for web applications largely benefits from a systematic approach, but
            also
            a portion
            of creativity.</li>
          <li>Acrobatics is sports with complex biomechanics (and also requires good communication skills). Preparing
            classes I
            devise complex progressions but the practice itself is mainly about experiencing, and while teaching I try
            to
            be
            intuitive, sensitive and embodied.</li>
          <li>Audio engineering is where musical art meets tech.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="scroll-box">
        <h2>Past careers</h2>
        <p>As a self-employed AcroYoga teacher, frequently collaborating with varying co-teachers and
          (co-)event-organizers, I have a track record of over 3000 students, from privates to big stages, and an
          increased number of invitations to
          teach at events and studios around the world. My unique style is renowned for comprehensible systematization,
          innovative
          approaches, subtle progressions and precise instructions. See <a href="http://www.FlyingMonkey.eu"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.FlyingMonkey.eu</a></p>
        <p>In my career as an acoustics engineer I designed and managed over 30 room- and architectural acoustics
          projects, from offices to high-end studios, communicating requirements and details with clients and partners
          to
          meet deadlines,
          budgets and leading-edge deliverables.</p>
        <p>As a sound engineer in more than 60 live concerts and several studio recordings I prove capable of managing
          very complex systems, effectively trace errors, all while coordinating multiple people, staying sharp to
          details
          and keeping
          a cool head when things got stressful.</p>

        <h2>Mito.this</h2>
        <p>“Mito.this” is first of all a reference to my nickname “Mito”. It also refers to the biological process of
          mitosis (cell
          division) as programming often comprises replication of code which then gets more and more specialized. And
          Mito.this
          also refers to the JavaScript keyword “this”, which is a very important concept, but can be quite tricky at
          times.</p>
